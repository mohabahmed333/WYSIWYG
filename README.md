âœ… Controlled Mode Example
In controlled mode, the editor's state is managed externally, and changes are handled via the onChange prop.
import { useState } from "react";
import Wysiwyg from "./components/WYSIWYG";

const ControlledEditor = () => {
const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(null);

return (
<Wysiwyg
value={editorState}
onChange={setEditorState}
editorStyle={{ border: "1px solid #ccc", padding: "10px" }}
/>
);
};

export default ControlledEditor;

âœ… Uncontrolled Mode Example
In uncontrolled mode, the editor manages its own state.

import WysiwygEditor from "./components/WYSIWYG";

const UncontrolledEditor = () => {
return <WysiwygEditor />;
};

export default UncontrolledEditor;
